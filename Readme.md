100 Days, 100 Websites
======================

I learned how to code by making 100 websites in 100 days and blogging and screen-recording the process.


Over these fun, challenging, and informative days, I covered:

*1-31:* vanilla javascript + jQuery
*32-51:* Angular.js
*52-72:* d3.js
*73-100:* Node.js + MEAN stack
